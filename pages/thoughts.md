## What makes me tick
Human life is blessed and cursed with five senses - sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch. It is the very basis of everything we know and understand.
When you're learning something specific, you often have to put aside your naturally stronger senses to acquire competence in another.
You're often told as a child to "find what you like". What it really means is understanding your strengths so that you fit into certain roles better. 
But society rewards people with certain abilities more than others. You must at some point have felt that its unfair that you are what you are, and that you have to force yourself to work extra hard to adapt.

And that is where the beauty lies. 

In this day and age, people are not only looking for natural talent, they are also looking for people who can put in the time and effort to make up for their natural short-comings. And believe me, there are a fair share of talented people who have never worked on them, because they received rewards for their natural talents. Its never sunshine and roses even for those who seem to be successful.

Now I get that its harsh that all juveniles are expected to grasp things as fast as, or faster than others in school. But you need to think from a "long game" perspective. Success that comes very quickly, also fades away very quickly.
So it doesn't matter if you're slow, behind everyone else and struggling to get where everyone else is. As long as you're putting in the effort, you're better than a majority who don't.

The bottom line? A little discipline, persistence and a strong will will always triumph, regardless of where you ideally fit or what your pitfalls are.
